## File Structure
A componentized approach is used, this will be the eventual standard (and particularly helpful, if using Angular's new router) as well as a great way to ensure a tasteful transition to Angular 2, when the time is ripe. Everything--or mostly everything, as we'll explore (below)--is a component. A component is a self-contained concern--may it be a feature or strictly-defined, ever-present element of the UI (such as a header, sidebar, or footer). Also characteristic of a component is that it harnesses its own stylesheets, templates, controllers, routes, services, and specs. This encapsulation allows us the comfort of isolation and structural locality. Here's how it looks:
```
client
⋅⋅app/
⋅⋅⋅⋅app.js * app entry file
⋅⋅⋅⋅app.html * app template
⋅⋅⋅⋅common/ * functionality pertinent to several components propagate into this directory
⋅⋅⋅⋅components/ * where components live
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅components.js * components entry file
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅home/ * home component
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅home.js * home entry file (routes, configurations, and declarations occur here)
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅home.component.js * home "directive"
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅home.controller.js * home controller
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅home.styl * home styles
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅home.html * home template
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅home.spec.js * home specs (for entry, component, and controller)
```

# Getting Started

## Running the App
Gulp is used to build and launch the development environment. After you have installed all dependencies, you may run the app. Running `gulp` will bundle the app with `webpack`, launch a development server, and watch all files. The port will be displayed in the terminal.

### Gulp Tasks
Here's a list of available tasks:
* `webpack`
  * runs Webpack, which will transpile, concatenate, and compress (collectively, "bundle") all assets and modules into `dist/bundle.js`. It also prepares `index.html` to be used as application entry point, links assets and created dist version of our application.
* `serve`
  * starts a dev server via `webpack-dev-server`, serving the client folder.
* `watch`
  * alias of `serve`
* `default` (which is the default task that runs when typing `gulp` without providing an argument)
	* runs `serve`.
* `component`
  * scaffolds a new Angular component. [Read below](#generating-components) for usage details.

### Testing
To run the tests, run `npm test` or `karma start`.

`Karma` combined with Webpack runs all files matching `*.spec.js` inside the `app` folder. This allows us to keep test files local to the component--which keeps us in good faith with continuing to build our app modularly. The file `spec.bundle.js` is the bundle file for **all** our spec files that Karma will run.

Be sure to define your `*.spec.js` files within their corresponding component directory. You must name the spec file like so, `[name].spec.js`. If you don't want to use the `.spec.js` suffix, you must change the `regex` in `spec.bundle.js` to look for whatever file(s) you want.
`Mocha` is the testing suite and `Chai` is the assertion library. If you would like to change this, see `karma.conf.js`.

### Generating Components
Following a consistent directory structure between components offers us the certainty of predictability. We can take advantage of this certainty by creating a gulp task to automate the "instantiation" of our components. The component boilerplate task generates this:
```
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName/
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.js // entry file where all its dependencies load
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.component.js
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.controller.js
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.html
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.styl // scoped to affect only its own template
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.spec.js // contains passing demonstration tests
```

You may, of course, create these files manually, every time a new module is needed, but that gets quickly tedious.
To generate a component, run `gulp component --name componentName`.

The parameter following the `--name` flag is the name of the component to be created. Ensure that it is unique or it will overwrite the preexisting identically-named component.

The component will be created, by default, inside `client/app/components`. To change this, apply the `--parent` flag, followed by a path relative to `client/app/components/`.

For example, running `gulp component --name signup --parent auth` will create a `signup` component at `client/app/components/auth/signup`.  

Running `gulp component --name footer --parent ../common` creates a `footer` component at `client/app/common/footer`.  

Because the argument to `--name` applies to the folder name **and** the actual component name, make sure to camelcase the component names.
